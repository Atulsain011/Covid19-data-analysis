# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing the global impact of COVID-19 using Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It explores various aspects such as total cases, deaths, GDP per capita, and the Human Development Index (HDI) across different continents.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data
- Perform high-level and low-level data analysis
- Identify key patterns and trends across continents
- Visualize insights using graphs
- Export meaningful results to CSV format

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from an open repository on GitHub:# Covid19-data-analysis

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SR1608/Datasets/main/covid-data.csv


## Key Features

- Shape and structure of the dataset examined
- Unique value counts and continent-wise breakdown
- Analysis of total cases and deaths
- Insights on GDP per capita and HDI in relation to COVID-19
- Filtered relevant columns for meaningful analysis
- Grouped data by continent and exported the result as a CSV
- Visualized continent-wise COVID cases using bar charts

## Output

- Cleaned and filtered dataset
- Grouped data saved to: `covid_analysis_groupby.csv`
- Visualizations highlighting key comparisons between continents
